# Monarch Migration Explorer

This generates a Google Map of sightings of Monarch butterflies over the past
six years.

In order to use it for yourself, rename creds-sample.js to creds.js and add a
Google Map API key and a Flickr API key.

Everything is browser-based at the moment, so there's no need for server-side
coding or even a webserver.
